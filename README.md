## Implementing atom class
Assignment 2

Due Date: Tue, Jan 23 12AM (midnight)

by E. Brown, 2019

This is an individual assignment. Sumbit an original solution.

Complete the implementation of the Molecule class in the molecule.py module.

A partial implementation of the module is provided in the git repository username@garfield.cs.mun.ca:/usr/local/pub/cs/cs2005/repos/asgns

Internal documentation in the module file should be sufficient for you to determine the expected behaviour of the Molecule class. You will need to modify or implement the following methods:

atoms (complete the stub)
check_symbols (fix a bug)
clean_copy (complete the stub)
__iter__ (override the inherited iterator)
You may change the module implementation using any standard python3 (as determined by the CS lab installation), but the behaviour of the module must be correct.

A testunit test case will be used to score your submission. You will receive 1 point for each test above 6 that your solution passes, to a maximum of 10 points. A copy of the test case is provided in the repository along with the partial implementation.

Submission instructions:

Instructions will be provided for you to push your solution to a personal git repository for submission. Use the same "assignment2" folder hierarchy in your submission repository as provided in the asgns repository.
